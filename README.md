# User

<h1>Assignment: User</h1>

For this assignment you will create the user class and add a couple methods!

<h2>Attributes:</h2>

On instantiation of a user, the following attributes should be passed in as arguments:

<li>first_name</li>
<li>last_name</li>
<li>email</li>
<li>age</li><br>

Also include default attributes:

<li>is_rewards_member - default value of False</li>
<li>gold_card_points = 0</li>

<h2>Methods:</h2>

<li><b>display_info(self</b>) - Have this method print all of the users' details on separate lines.</li>
<li><b>enroll(self)</b> - Have this method change the user's member status to True and set their gold card points to 200.</li>
<li><b>spend_points(self, amount)</b> - have this method decrease the user's points by the amount specified.</li><br>

<b><i>Ninja Bonuses:</b></i><br>

<li>Add logic in the enroll method to check if they are a member already, and if they are, print "User already a member." and return False, otherwise return True.</li>
<li>Add logic in the spend points method to be sure they have enough points to spend that amount and handle appropriately.</li><br>
